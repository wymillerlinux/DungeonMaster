# DungeonMaster
A text-based quest game for masters of dungeons! <br>

## Installation
Before starting the installation, there's a few things you have to do first. <br>

First, clone the repo with a `git clone https://github.com/wymillerlinux/DungeonMaster` to a directory. If you don't have git, [git](https://git-scm.com/) it!<br>

Second, install a IDE if you want to review, edit or contribute to my code. If you're on MS Windows, install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and follow the on-screen prompts. If you are on a Mac, you can either download [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) or Mono/MonoDevelop. If you are on Linux or FreeBSD, download MonoDevelop with your package manager.<br>

No other dependices are needed at this time. 

## Running
Once you have loaded your IDE with the project, all that has to be done is pressing F5!

## Troubleshooting
I'll post something here if I run into any errors that people might have not noticed.

## Contributing
Contributions are allowed after December 16th, 2017. This for NMC 195 final so I would _love_ your help but no touchy.
